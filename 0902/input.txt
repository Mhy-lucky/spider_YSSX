(People's Daily Online/Zhang Jun) What comes to mind when you think of bamboo products?
Bamboo chopsticks, mats, fans â€” or perhaps something else?
In Guangde, east China's Anhui Province, the remarkable versatility of bamboo is transforming perceptions of the traditional industry.
Everyday items such as straws, keyboards, computer mice and razors, once made from plastic, are now being crafted from bamboo.
The potential uses for this sustainable material are broader than ever imagined.

Around noon on May 14, a drone landed at an industrial park in Baohe district, Hefei, east China's Anhui Province, delivering coffee from a shopping mall 3 kilometers away.
The coffee remained refreshingly cold.
"The route was opened two months ago.
It's our 80th regularly operating drone route in Hefei," said Su Ruixia, deputy general manager of Hefei Songba Feihe Low Altitude Logistics Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of drone manufacturer Antwork Technology.
Since launching operations in February 2024, the company has established nearly 100 drone routes across the city.

(People's Daily Online/Miao Zijian) In February 2024, Antwork Technology set up its national operations center in Baohe district, Hefei.
The following month, the city's first blood delivery drone route was launched, along with six others supporting emergency medical needs such as blood, medication, lab samples, and medical supplies.
"The drones fly at around 100 meters and cover about 1 kilometer per minute," Su explained.
Compared to traditional methods, drones cut delivery time by more than half, ensuring a faster response for urgent hospital supplies, Su said.
Early one morning last July, a woman undergoing surgery at a Hefei hospital suffered severe bleeding and urgently needed a large blood supply.
Within two hours, drones made eight round trips, flying a total of about 170 kilometers and delivering over 10,000 milliliters of blood.

We've opened nearly 100 routes and built close to 40 drone hubs," said Su.
Behind the drone delivery routes is a team of drone operators.
"Each operator monitors up to eight drones flying in different cities," said 23-year-old Zhang Yuxin, a drone operator at the national operations center of Hefei Songba Feihe Low Altitude Logistics Co., Ltd. At the monitoring center, pilots like Zhang oversee drone operations in more than 30 cities, ensuring "air expressways" operate smoothly and safely.

We should respect our differences, maintain strategic communication, build up consensus, and strengthen solidarity and collaboration.
We should make the pie of cooperation bigger, and fully utilize the endowment of every country, so that we can fulfill our responsibility for peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region.
Second, we should pursue mutual benefit and win-win results.
We need to better align our development strategies and promote the high-quality implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative, so that in planning and building relevant projects together and benefiting from them together we can strengthen the momentum of regional development and improve the well-being of the people.
We should leverage the strengths of our mega-sized markets and economic complementarity between member states, and improve trade and investment facilitation.
We should enhance cooperation in such areas as energy, infrastructure, green industry, the digital economy, scientific and technological innovation, and artificial intelligence.
We should march toward modernization hand in hand by bringing out the best in one another and working together for a shared future.
Third, we should champion openness and inclusiveness.
The vast land of Asia and Europe, a cradle of ancient civilizations where the earliest exchanges between the East and the West took place, has been a driving force behind human progress.
Since ancient times, people of different countries have bartered and traded for mutual benefit and learned from each other.
SCO member states need to enhance mutual understanding and friendship through people-to-people exchanges, firmly support one another in economic cooperation, and jointly cultivate a garden of civilizations in which all cultures flourish in prosperity and harmony through mutual enlightenment.
Fourth, we should uphold fairness and justice.
We must promote a correct historical perspective on World War II, and oppose the Cold War mentality, bloc confrontation and bullying practices.
We should safeguard the U.N.-centered international system, and support the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core.
We should advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and make the global governance system more just and equitable.
Fifth, we should strive for real results and high efficiency.
We should continuously promote SCO reform, increase resources input and enhance capacity building to improve its institutional structure and make its decision-making more scientific and its actions more efficient.
We should put into use the SCO Universal Center for Countering Security Challenges and Threats and the SCO Anti-drug Center and set up an SCO development bank as soon as possible to provide stronger underpinnings for security and economic cooperation among member states.
Colleagues, China always aligns its development with that of the SCO and with the aspiration of the people of member states for a better life.
To date, China's investment stock in other SCO member states has exceeded US$84 billion, and its annual bilateral trade with other SCO member states has surpassed US$500 billion.
China has always focused on taking real actions to ensure better development of the SCO.
Going forward, China plans to implement 100 "small and beautiful" livelihood projects in member states with such need.
It will provide RMB 2 billion yuan in grant to SCO member states within this year, and will issue an additional RMB 10 billion yuan in loan to the member banks of the SCO Interbank Consortium over the next three years.
Starting from next year, China will double the current number of SCO-specific scholarships, and launch an SCO innovative PhD program to jointly train high-caliber talent in academic as well as scientific and technological research.
In the next five years, China will establish 10 Luban Workshops in SCO member states and provide 10,000 human resources training opportunities.
Colleagues, As a Chinese saying goes, "Where will prevails, no boundary holds."
Let us stay true to SCO's founding mission, step up to undertake our duties, promote the sound and sustained development of the SCO with greater resolve and more practical measures, and march steadily toward a brighter tomorrow of a community with a shared future for humanity.
Thank you.
Tomorrow, I will join our colleagues at the Meeting of the Council of Heads of Member States.
We will also convene the "SCO Plus" Meeting with leaders of non-SCO members and international organizations.
We will focus on how to strengthen cooperation, promote development, and improve global governance.
I am confident that with the collective efforts of all parties, this Summit will be a complete success and the SCO will play an even greater role, achieve greater development, and make greater contribution to strengthening solidarity and cooperation among the member states, pooling the strength of the Global South, and promoting the cause of human advancement.
As a Chinese saying goes, "In a race of a hundred boats, those who row the hardest will lead."
Let us uphold the Shanghai Spirit and set out from Tianjin on a new voyage filled with hope toward an even brighter future.
